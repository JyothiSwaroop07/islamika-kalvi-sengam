            We believe Islam is a divinely revealed ethical and moral approach to life for mankind, guiding it to 
            achieve peace, progress and success.
                The Islamic Foundation represents a pioneering initiative, at the 
                academic and educational levels, to enable Muslims, and humanity at large, to discover the 
                true potential of Islam. We aim to support Muslims to become active participants in helping to build a plural, respectful and harmonious world.
